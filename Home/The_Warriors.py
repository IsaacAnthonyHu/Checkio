# Let's start with the simple task - one-on-one duel.
# You need to create the class Warrior,
# the instances of which will have 2 parameters - health (equal to 50 points) and attack (equal to 5 points),
# and 1 property - is_alive, which can be True (if warrior's health is > 0) or False (in the other case).
# In addition you have to create the second unit type - Knight,
# which should be the subclass of the Warrior but have the increased attack - 7.
# Also you have to create a function fight(),
# which will initiate the duel between 2 warriors and define the strongest of them.
# The duel occurs according to the following principle:
# every turn one of the warriors will hit another one and the last will lose his health in the same value
# as the attack of the first warrior. After that, the second warrior will do the same to the first one.
# If in the end of the turn the first warrior has > 0 health and the other one doesnâ€™t, the function should return True,
# in the other case it should return False.
# Example:
# chuck = Warrior()
# bruce = Warrior()
# carl = Knight()
# dave = Warrior()
#
# fight(chuck, bruce) == True
# fight(dave, carl) == False
# chuck.is_alive == True
# bruce.is_alive == False
# carl.is_alive == True
# dave.is_alive == False

# Input:
# The warriors.
# Output:
# The result of the duel (True or False).
# How it is used:
# For computer games development.
# Precondition: 2 types of units
