# You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
# "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
# "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
# "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5;
# The number as a string for other cases.
# Input:
# A number as an integer.
#
# Output:
# The answer as a string.
#
# Example:
# checkio(15) == "Fizz Buzz"
# checkio(6) == "Fizz"
# checkio(5) == "Buzz"
# checkio(7) == "7"
#
# How it is used:
# Here you can learn how to write the simplest function and work with if-else statements.
#
# Precondition:
# 0 < number â‰¤ 1000

# Your optional code here
# You can import some modules or create additional functions


def checkio(number: int) -> str:
	# Your code here
	# It's main function. Don't remove this function
	# It's using for auto-testing and must return a result for check.
	if number%3 == 0 and number%5 == 0:
		return "Fizz Buzz"
	elif number%3 != 0 and number%5 == 0:
		return "Buzz"
	elif number%3 == 0 and number%5 != 0:
		return "Fizz"
	else:
		return str(number)
	# replace this for solution

# Some hints:
# Convert a number in the string with str(n)

# These "asserts" using only for self-checking and not necessary for auto-testing
